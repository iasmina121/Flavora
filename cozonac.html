          <h2>Romanian "Cozonac"</h2>
          <p>
            
Cozonaci are sweet, fluffy bread loaves that are a big part of Romanian celebrations like Easter and Christmas. They're made with ingredients like eggs, butter, and sugar, and they can have yummy fillings like nuts or raisins. Cozonaci are often braided and have a special meaning of togetherness.

              <h5>step 1</h5>
        
            <p>
              Begin by combining flour, sugar, yeast, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs,melted butter, and milk.

              Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.          </div>

              <h5>step 2</h5>

            <p>
              Once the dough has risen, gently punch it down to release the air bubbles. Divide the dough into equal portions, depending on how many cozonaci you want to make. Working with one portion at a time, roll out the dough into a rectangle or oval shape on a floured surface, about 1.5 cm thick. Spread your desired fillings (such as chopped nuts, raisins, cocoa powder, or Turkish delight) evenly over the surface of the dough. Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log, making sure to seal the seam tightly. Optionally, you can braid multiple logs together for a decorative effect.          <div class="single-instruction">
  
              <h5>step 3</h5>
            <p>
              Place the shaped cozonaci on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving some space between each one. Cover the cozonaci loosely with a kitchen towel and let them rise for an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until they have puffed up slightly.


          <div class="single-instruction">
  
            <h5>step 4</h5>
          <p>
            Preheat your oven to 180-200°C (350-400°F), depending on your recipe. If desired, brush the tops of the cozonaci with an egg wash (1 beaten egg mixed with a tablespoon of water) for a shiny finish. Bake the cozonaci in the preheated oven for 30-45 minutes, or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the cozonaci from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.

        <p>
          Serve the cozonaci warm or at room temperature, and enjoy the delicious, homemade goodness! Adjustments can be made based on your recipe's specifics and personal preferences. Happy baking!      </div>
