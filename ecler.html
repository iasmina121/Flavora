              In a saucepan, combine water, milk, butter, salt, and sugar (if using). Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add flour all at once, stirring vigorously until a smooth dough forms. Continue to cook and stir for about 2 minutes until the dough pulls away from the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a mixing bowl and let it cool slightly. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the dough is smooth and glossy.            </p>

            <p>
              Preheat the oven to 200Â°C . Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the choux pastry dough into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the dough onto the prepared baking sheet into 10-12 centimeter lengths, leaving space between each eclair. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the eclairs are puffed up and golden brown. Remove from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack.          </div>

              In a saucepan, heat the milk until it just begins to simmer. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth. Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla extract, and transfer the pastry cream to a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use.            </p>

          <p>
            Once the eclairs have cooled completely, use a sharp knife to make a small slit on the side of each eclair. Transfer the chilled pastry cream to a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe the cream into each eclair through the slit until they are filled.          </p>

          In a heatproof bowl, combine the dark chocolate, heavy cream, and butter. Place the bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and stir until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the powdered sugar (if using). Let the glaze cool slightly.        </p>

      <div class="single-instruction">
  
        <h5>step 6</h5>
      <p>
        Dip the top of each filled eclair into the chocolate glaze, allowing any excess to drip off. Place the glazed eclairs on a wire rack to set for a few minutes.      </p>

        <h5>step 7</h5>

        Once the glaze has set, your eclairs are ready to be served! Enjoy these delicious pastries as a delightful treat with a cup of coffee or tea.    </div>
